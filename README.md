Reggie Take
Reggie Take is a restaurant project built using Spring Boot, designed for hands-on learning and practice. It's a tailored software product for the food and beverage industry (restaurants, eateries) encompassing both a system management backend and a mobile application. The system management backend is primarily for internal staff use, allowing management of categories, dishes, meal packages, orders, and employees. The mobile app caters to consumers, enabling them to browse dishes, add to cart, and place orders online.

The project is divided into three development phases:

Phase One: Basic requirements implementation, with the mobile app developed in HTML5, accessible through mobile browsers.

Phase Two: Mobile app improvements, transitioning to a WeChat mini-program for enhanced user convenience.

Phase Three: System optimization and performance enhancement.

Three user types correspond to three roles in this project: backend system administrator, backend regular staff, and consumer (mobile app user).

Backend System Administrator: Full access to all backend system operations after logging in.

Backend Regular Staff: Manages dishes, meal packages, and orders (excluding staff management) after logging in.

Consumer (Mobile App User): Can browse dishes, add to cart, set addresses, and place orders online after logging in.
